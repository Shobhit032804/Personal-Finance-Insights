### Personal-Finance-Insights
This project leverages Power BI to analyze personal finance data, offering detailed insights into income and expenses. The interactive visualizations enable users to monitor financial health, manage bills, and track trends over time to facilitate better financial planning.

### Overview:-  
The project centers on transforming and analyzing personal finance data to uncover spending patterns, income trends, and bill management. By employing Power BI, I created dynamic visualizations that provide a comprehensive view of monthly finances, and allow users to have a check on their personal finance.

### Key Features:- 
1. Expense Analysis: Tracks spending by category and source, highlighting significant expense contributors.  
2. Income Breakdown: Displays income trends and sources over time.  
3. Bill Management: Monitors the due dates and payment status of bills.  
4. Monthly Financial Overview: Summarizes total income, expenses, savings, and outstanding bills.  
5. Data Visualization: Features bar charts, pie charts, and KPI cards to present financial metrics effectively.

### Tools Used:-
